# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application displays the current weather, 5-day forecast, and saves locations the user has already searched for. This application uses a server-side API to gather data about the location the user types in and displays the weather in that specified location. Bootstrap was used for styling and DayJS was used for time stamps.
